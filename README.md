# EV Battery Impact Dashboard

Welcome to the **EV Battery Impact Dashboard**, a Shiny app built in R that explores the world of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in 2024—sales by brand, where batteries are made (China and U.S.), and the pollution they leave behind. Whether you’re a car enthusiast curious about Tesla vs. BYD or a data geek diving into CO2 emissions, this app has something for you!

## Summary
This project started with a simple question: who’s leading the electric vehicle race in 2024? Using Statista’s latest data (Feb 2025), we found BYD dominating with 4.1M PEV sales, Tesla at 1.79M, and brands like Volkswagen and BMW charging up the ranks. But it’s not just about sales—batteries power these EVs, and their production has a big environmental footprint. 

The Shiny app delivers:
- **Sales Snapshot:** A colorful bar chart (blue for BEVs, green for PHEVs) of top brands’ 2024 PEV sales.
- **Battery Pollution:** A table breaking down CO2, water, and waste impacts from battery-making.
- **Global Production Maps:** Leaflet maps pinpointing battery hubs in China (e.g., Shenzhen, Ningde) and the U.S. (e.g., Sparks, NV; Warren, OH), with clickable details on producers, pollution, and risks.

For non-tech folks, it’s an interactive way to see how EVs are shaping our roads and planet. For coders, it’s a clean R setup with `shiny`, `leaflet`, and `ggplot2`, ready to tweak or expand.

## Background
Electric vehicles are booming—global PEV sales hit 17.1M in 2024 (Rho Motion)—but batteries are the heart of the story. China cranks out 70–80% of them (ITIF, 2024), relying on a 60% coal-powered grid (MIT News, 2021), while the U.S. is racing to catch up, powering 70% of its EV cells domestically (DOE, 2024) thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. This app digs into the trade-offs: sales growth versus pollution costs, from Shanghai’s gigafactories to Kentucky’s new plants.

## Features
- **PEV Sales Tab:** See who’s winning—BYD’s 4.1M vs. Tesla’s 1.79M—via a stacked bar chart, plus raw stats.
- **Pollution Impact Tab:** Quick facts on battery production’s toll (e.g., 124.5 kg CO2/kWh in China).
- **China Map Tab:** Click cities like Ningde (CATL) for production capacity and pollution data.
- **U.S. Map Tab:** Explore U.S. plants (e.g., Tesla in Nevada) with automaker links, CO2 estimates, and risks like water depletion.

## Data Insights
- **Sales:** BYD’s 4.1M PEVs (57% PHEVs) outpace Tesla’s 1.79M (all BEVs), with Wuling, VW, BMW, and Mercedes trailing. Europe’s PEVs hit 23% of car sales (Statista, 2024).
- **China Production:** Ningde (CATL) and Shenzhen (BYD) lead, with 120 and 100 GWh capacity, pumping out batteries at 124.5 kg CO2/kWh due to coal (Sun et al., 2023).
- **U.S. Production:** Sparks, NV (Tesla) and Warren, OH (GM) churn out 50 and 35 GWh, supplying Tesla, GM, Ford, and more, with CO2 at 50–75 kg/kWh (cleaner grids, MIT, 2022).
- **Pollution Risks:** China’s water use (50 L/kWh) and U.S. mining runoff threaten rivers; coal grids spike air pollution.

## Why This Matters
EVs promise a greener future—17.1M sold in 2024—but batteries are the catch. China’s coal-heavy production (70–80% of batteries) pumps out 30% more CO2 than gas cars over a lifecycle (X posts, 2021), risking climate goals. In the U.S., cleaner grids cut emissions, but mining and PFAS waste could poison water and health (The Examination, 2024). For automakers, it’s jobs (thousands in the Battery Belt) versus costs (IRA credits vs. supply chain shifts). For us? It’s cleaner air or dirtier rivers—a trade-off that hits home, from gas prices to floods. This dashboard makes it real, not abstract.

## Conclusion
The **EV Battery Impact Dashboard** bridges sales hype with production reality. Non-tech folks get a clear view of EV leaders and their environmental cost; techies get a robust R app to hack or scale. Built from Statista’s 2024 sales, DOE factory data, and pollution studies, it’s a starting point—add your own data or ideas! EVs are here to stay, but where and how we make their batteries will shape the planet. Fork it, tweak it, let’s keep the conversation rolling!
